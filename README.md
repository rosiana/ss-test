# Refund Page (Mobile-First)
Developed using **Harp** as **Node.js** static page generator containing integrated preprocessor (**Jade** for HTML and **Less** for CSS).
Main features/interaction highlights listed below.
### Multi-steps form
This method simplifies many form elements to be shown at once (since mobile screens are limited in size) and divides form-filling flow into different sections by its information types. Users can easily go back to previous step and return by clicking on navigation buttons or step wizard circles.
### Minimize errors and unnecessary interactions
Users who happens to forget filling required forms doesn't have to click submit/next buttons once again only to get rid of error messages and continue, since submit/next buttons are disabled until all required data provided.
### Single-page web app
No loading time to get to the next step, all valid data sent at once.
### Responsive, also fine and tidy-looking on desktop
The development of this page also considers desktop layout for Sistas who access the page via desktop. Style used in this page is flat design since it suits well with pages with a lot of texts and contents.
